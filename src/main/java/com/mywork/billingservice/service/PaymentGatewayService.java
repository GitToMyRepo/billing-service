/**
 * Simulates calling an external payment gateway (e.g. Stripe, PayPal).
 *
 * Demonstrates Circuit Breaker and Retry patterns using Resilience4j.
 *
 * Circuit Breaker states:
 * - CLOSED  — normal operation, requests pass through
 * - OPEN    — too many failures, requests immediately return fallback (no calls made)
 * - HALF_OPEN — after wait duration, allows a few test requests through to check recovery
 *
 * In a real billing system this would call an external payment API.
 * Here we simulate failures to demonstrate the pattern.
